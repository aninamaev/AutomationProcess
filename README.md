# AutomationProcess
Xamarin app, both Android and iOS
This idea came in a discussion with a friend of mine about an automation of the process in his bakery. We did not put it in practice, but I made this small app just to show this how this idea would look in a mobile app.

The application is in its first steps, as we did not make a project of it. It does not have even a database integrated, just a class the would fake a database.

Most interfaces are in xaml, only one is only code because I did not know how to make graphical elements dynamics in xaml. If anyone has idea and wants to share, I would be pleased.
